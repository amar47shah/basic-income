## Contributing

Contributions of all kinds, including additions, corrections, improvements, and discussion are welcome!

We hope you'll join and help, in small ways or large. Here are few notes before you jump in.

**Questions and discussion**:
[File issues](https://github.com/amar47shah/basic-income/issues) liberally! Don’t be shy about creating issues — they are the only way to discuss things here. Just tag it as a question or discussion. We or others can answer, and it may lead to improvements to the guide.

**Corrections and improvements**:
[File issues](https://github.com/amar47shah/basic-income/issues) describing the problem.  Use them to discuss topics, ask questions, identify issues, or suggest improvements. [Pull requests](https://github.com/amar47shah/basic-income/pulls) with changes are even better. Please keep them small and focused, so we can add items individually.

Of course, please review current issues and pull requests to avoid duplication.
